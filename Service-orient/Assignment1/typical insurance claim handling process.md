    To start with, the general public has two persistent questions about insurance:

1.Can the insurance company go out of business/fail/run away/lose money?

2.Is the insurance company deliberately/deliberately/deliberately unwilling to settle claims?

These two problems do not understand clearly, dare not take out money to insure.

    First question
China's insurance industry is a world leader in regulation, particularly of solvency.China Insurance Regulatory Commission is not a vegetarian, you said that the ye live the market may be a little breathless, but you said that his supervision is not good, is to my great country system of contempt, insurance involved in the national economy and people's livelihood, is not allowed any mistake.
In addition to various rigorous and scientific regulatory rules (C-ROSS) and solvency measurement, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, the Ministry of Finance and the People's Bank of China have also established the China Insurance Guarantee Fund, a pool of 70 billion yuan, to ensure the solvency protection for the policies of bankrupt insurance companies in extreme cases.
This is really not what each country area can do, Hong Kong insurance so can blow, they can not have such strict regulation and safeguard system.
So the answer is: there is a probability that an insurance company will go bust, but under a strict regulatory regime, that probability is very small, and even if it did, there is an insurance fund to protect consumers' policies.
    
    Second question
  Our concern, from the various claims dispute reports, insurance companies refused to compensate for what are the reasons?
According to a document from Jiangsu CirC, 52% of the claims are rejected because the insured fails to truthfully inform the medical history, 27% belong to the exclusions stipulated in the terms, and 12% belong to the protection scope not conforming to the terms.
The data clearly show that the biggest reason for the refusal of claims is that consumers misunderstand the products or have omissions or concealment behaviors in the sales and signing of insurance contracts.
Doubt claims, rather than understand the insurance company's claims processing process, understand the work content of each link, when the insurance ready.
Ok, to get down to business, a picture to understand the insurance company claims processing process.
    
    Insurance company's claims processing process

    Insurance company claims processing process, 
    
   roughly divided into five links
    
    1, the report
Simply speaking, anyone can report to the police, call the customer service number of the insurance company, and inform the insured of the id number. The customer service personnel will guide you to the follow-up link.

To pay attention to the requirements of reporting time, life insurance claims prescription is generally 5 years, life insurance outside life insurance is generally 2 years.

    2, single
Here is a little more complex, in addition to claims application, different types of insurance have different material requirements, claims personnel will elaborate, divided into such two large:

Applicant's documents: documents relating to the identity and relationship of the insured and beneficiary.

Data of claim certificate: death certificate (death/account closing/cremation) related to life insurance and accident insurance, medical appraisal of degree of disability;Pathological and medical reports of serious diseases;Medical insurance expense list, invoice, operation record, etc.
    
    3, at the beginning of nuclear
The receiving personnel will transfer the application data to the audit personnel for preliminary verification. There are two possibilities:

If the materials are complete and the facts are clear and meet the claim requirements, the payment shall be notified within 2-3 working days. If the time is longer than that, the initial verification has not been approved.

If there is an obvious or suspected exemption of liability, enter into the negotiation or investigation (the amount or subsequent risk is small, and the exemption matters are clearly transferred to the negotiation;On the contrary, refer to the investigation).

    4, talking
The negotiation staff will communicate with the insured (the applicant). After verification of the situation, the insured will transfer it to the audit if there is no objection.If the insured has any objection, the negotiating staff will refer the matter to the investigation for further information.

    5, investigation
Investigators will carry out detailed evidence collection work, and we will discuss the specific contents of the investigation later.The investigator will report the findings back to the association, who will then communicate with the applicant further.

After the completion of the investigation, the consultation and communication will form the final conclusion, and the applicant will accept or take legal means to appeal.

Look at this process, there is no malicious denial of insurance department as depicted in the movie. The operators follow the rules and procedures. The insurance company's compensation is not paid by the staff themselves.The probability and amount of these payments are also fully considered by the actuary before the launch of the product.

In the whole claims processing process, investigation is very important. Knowing what the insurance company investigates will help us understand the health information more accurately and avoid claims problems.
